# PEOBLEM SOLVING PATTERNS - these are not the only ones !

## Frequency Counter Pattern - O{N}
    > uses objects / sets to collect values/frequencies of values
    > example: problems/P1.js

## Multiple Pointers Pattern - generally, tc=O(N) sc=O(1)
    > creating pointers/values that correspond to an index or position and move 
      towards ths beginning, ed or middle based on a certain condition
    > efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
    > example: problems/P2.js

## Sliding Window Pattern - O(N)
    > creating a window which can either be an array or number from one 
      position to another
    > depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or 
      closes (and a new window is created)
    > very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
    > example: problems/P3.js

## Divide and Conquer
    > dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then 
      repeating a process with a subset of data.
    > can decrease time complexity tremendously
    > example: problems/P4.js
