# Abstract Data Type(ADT) 
#### It is a data type, where only behavior is defined but not implementation.

#### Opposite of ADT is Concrete Data Type (CDT), where it contains an implementation of ADT.

#### Examples:
Array, List, Map, Queue, Set, Stack, Table, Tree, and Vector are ADTs. Each of these ADTs has many implementations i.e. CDT. The container is a high-level ADT of above all ADTs.

#### Real life example:
book is Abstract (Telephone Book is an implementation)

### Actually Abstract Data Types is:

Concepts or theoretical model that defines a data type logically
Specifies set of data and set of operations that can be performed on that data
Does not mention anything about how operations will be implemented
"Existing as an idea but not having a physical idea"
For example, lets see specifications of some Abstract Data Types,

List Abstract Data Type: initialize(), get(), insert(), remove(), etc.
Stack Abstract Data Type: push(), pop(), peek(), isEmpty(), isNull(), etc.
Queue Abstract Data Type: enqueue(), dequeue(), size(), peek(), etc.
