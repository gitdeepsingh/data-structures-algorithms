/*
Queue is dynamic set in which:
Element is inserted (ENQUEUE) to the end of the Queue (tail).
Element is deleted/removed (DEQUEUE) from the beginning of the Queue (head).
And the Delete operation is based on FIFO (First-In, First-Out) â€” 
like in real queue, the longest stayed person (aka the first on arrived to queue) got to go first.
