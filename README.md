# Big O - to analyze performance
## Time complexity in JS:
Relationship between runtime of an algo and the input provided.
When always contsant operations are performed on an input - O(1)
Number of ops is bounded by a multiple of n(say 10n) - O(n)
O(n) ops inside of a O(n) op - O(n^2)


## Space complexity* in JS:
    primitives like boolean, null, undefined - constant O(1)
    strings - O(n)
    referece types like array - O(n)
        ,where n = length

## logs complexity*

# Problem Solving
    1. understand the problem
    2. think of concrete examples (all possible input? outputs? special/edge cases?)
    3. break it down 
    4. solve / simplify
    5. revisit and refactor

# NOTE: 
> auxiliary space complexity / space complexity - Space required by the algorith, excluding the input.
> log2(8) = 3 => 2^3=8 i.e. log(value) = exponent => 2^exponent = value
